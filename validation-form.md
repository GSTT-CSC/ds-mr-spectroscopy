to PACS.

## 3. Quality Relevance

*Rate these aspects with yes (y) or no (n). If any of these aspects is rated as yes, the system is quality
relevant and should be validated.*

## 8. Annex: Additional Information for Criticality Classification

**Criticality High**

* A software failure can lead to physical harm requiring medical intervention
* Software controls parameters or data that are essential during product release
* Software manages data relevant for clinical evaluation or product approval
* Software manages data from which conclusions about incident messages or recall actions are drawn

**Criticality Moderate**

* A software failure can lead to physical damage requiring medical intervention
* Software administers documents whose loss endangers the certification
* Software controls intermediate results in the product realization, which are revealed in later steps by
  other processes

**Criticality Low**

* Software manages documents that play a role in the QM system, and whose loss would lead to an audit variance
