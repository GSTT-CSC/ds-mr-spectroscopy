# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of the Clinical Risk Management Plan (CRMP) is to define the implementation of, and any variation to, the CSC Clinical Safety Management System.
It describes how the programme will conduct clinical risk management to ensure patient safety with respect to services provided and the interrelated and 
interactive activities that will occur to ensure that the programme meets the requirements of DCB0129 and DCB0160.

In fulfilling this purpose, any variation to the standard practices and procedures to be followed, as defined by the Clinical Risk Management System (CRMS), 
when performing the activities of the programme are documented here in this document.

This CRMP identifies the means by which the programme shall be controlled to ensure that the safety work is of high quality, conforms to the requirements of the 
CSMS and any specific programme requirements. This document will be updated when the plan changes in any way as to deviate from what has been committed to deliver.
This will be decided by the programme and Clinical Safety Officer and/or Team.

# Project Overview & Clinical Safety
In summary, this project seeks to develop a plugin to the dicomserver platform in order to facilitate the measurement of quantities of metabolites from 
MR Spectroscopy data. The details of the project are outlined in the Project Proposal section of the README.md file.

# Impact of DCB0129 and DCB0160 on Programme
Since CSC will be both the Manufacturer and user of the software, the project will therefore adhere to all applicable requirements of DCB0129 and DCB0160 in this regard.
 
# Clinical Risk Management File
The project GitHub repository contains all relevant clinical safety documentation and will perform the function of the Clinical Risk Management File. This folder 
will be managed by the Clinical Safety Officer and Clinical Safety Engineer (if they are different people).

## Resources / Personnel
The Clinical Safety Officer is responsible for ensuring the clinical safety of the programme through the application of clinical risk management.  The Clinical 
Safety Officer is a suitably qualified and experienced clinician who holds current registration with their relevant professional body and has had appropriate 
training for this role.

Key responsibilities include:
•	approval of the Clinical Risk Management Plan to confirm that the plan is appropriate and achievable in the context of the Health IT System development and 
modification;

•	ensuring that clinical risk management activities are completed in accordance with the Clinical Risk Management Plan (this document);

•	reviewing and approving of all safety documentation including Clinical Safety Case Reports and Hazard Logs;

•	reviewing evidence in the Clinical Risk Management File to ensure it is complete and supports the Clinical Safety Case Report;

•	escalating any unacceptable safety risks.


## Clinical Risk Evaluation and Management
The clinical risk matrix, evaluation and management process used is defined below and can also be found in more detail within the appendix. The hazard assessment 
process will follow the standard Clinical Risk Management System approach.

Hazards may be identified in other ways during the development and use of the programme such as:

•	Discovery during design of a solution by supplier or NHS Organisation;

•	Testing of amended functionality;

•	Ad hoc testing of live service functionality;

•	Reporting of an incident or problem within the live service; and


For each identified hazard, the following information will be defined and recorded on the Hazard Sheet and summarised on the Hazard Log:

•	Hazard number;

•	Hazard description;

•	Potential clinical impact – this will describe the effect of the hazard in the care setting and potential impact on the patient;

•	Possible causes – these may be technical, human, error etc.  A hazard may have a number of causes; and

•	Existing controls – these are identified existing controls or measures that are currently in place and will remain in place post implementation that provide mitigation again the hazard, i.e. will be used as part of the initial Hazard Risk Assessment.

Each Hazard will be discussed by the programme Clinical Safety team and any other appropriate people.  They will perform the following tasks and record the outcome in the Hazard Sheet and a summary in the Hazard Log:

•	Estimation of clinical risks;

•	Clinical risk evaluation; and

•	Clinical risk control option management.
 
Estimation of clinical risks.

For each identified hazard estimation will be made of the clinical risk.  This will include the severity of the hazard, the likelihood of the hazard and the resulting clinical risk.  The estimation process will follow that established by the safety processes defined in DCB0129.
